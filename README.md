All animals and people have own colors and personalities, even though they look similar each other some parts. The same shape of a dog or humanâ€™s face will be given, but each viewer can make own patterns and the direction of light at the same time.

**Let's start and enjoy mapping on the web!**
1. Click left or right button = change the models
2. Mouse position = the direction of light, add textures & colors
